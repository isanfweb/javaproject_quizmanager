ARCHITECTURE:
In this Project, I did my best to cover all the functionalities needed to Evaluate a Quiz,
From Model, DTO, Services and Logic Functions.

PDF:
To export into PDF, I added some iTextPDF libraries in the ./lib directory.

DB:
I used H2 as DB, with persistent mod, then the DB file is inside the ./DB directory.

Thanks for understanding Professor, and have a nice day!
